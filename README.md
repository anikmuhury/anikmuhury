# Hi there, I'm Anik Muhury! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I'm a PhD student at University of Tennessee, Knoxville with a keen interest in Robotics, Control, and Model order reduction. 
Whether I'm debugging code, exploring new technologies, or contributing to community projects, I'm always eager to learn and share my knowledge. 
When I'm not coding, I enjoy watching games!

Thanks for visiting my profile! ðŸš€
